# Year1_Info_Sys_Assignment
Year 1 Information Systems group project

This is a group project created in conjunction with Janet D'Souza and Mariam Elghami.

The brief was to analyse a fictional bicycle hire business and convert its paper-based record keeping system into one organised using a computerised database.

To create the database we used Oracle's SQL Developer.
